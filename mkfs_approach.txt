1. Parse command-line arguments: 

Parse the input arguments, such as the device to format and optional parameters like block size, inode size, etc.

2. Open the device:

Open the device file (e.g., /dev/sda1) for reading and writing.

3. Create and initialise the superblock: 

Create an instance of the ext2_super_block structure and fill in the appropriate values for the file system you are creating, such as the total number of inodes, blocks, etc.

4. Write the superblock to the device: 

Write the initialised superblock to the device at the appropriate location (usually the second block).

5. Create and initialise the block group descriptor table: 

Create an instance of the ext2_group_desc structure for each block group in the file system and fill in the appropriate values, such as the location of the block bitmap, inode bitmap, and inode table.

6. Write the block group descriptor table to the device: 

Write the initialised block group descriptor table to the device at the appropriate location (usually the third block).

7. Create and initialise the block and inode bitmaps:

For each block group, create and initialise the block and inode bitmaps. Write the bitmaps to the device at the locations specified in the block group descriptor.

8. Create and initialise the inode tables:** suggestations;

For each block group, create and initialise the inode table. Write the inode table to the device at the location specified in the block group descriptor.

9. Create the root directory: 

Create the root directory with the necessary entries (e.g., ".", ".."). Update the inode table and block bitmap accordingly.

10. Close the device:

Close the device file after all the necessary data has been written.
