## fsck in linux

fsck is used to check and optionally repair one or more linux fsck
filesystems, file sys can be a device name
( e.g 

/dev/sda1,/dev/sdb1
)

or a mount point
(
    e.g. /, /usr , /home

)
fsck is similar to the chkdsk 
most of the times it runs during boot times

## can be used with three modes of operation

1.check for errors and let the user decide what should be done with each errors
2.check for errors and make repairs automatically,
3.check for errors and display the error but does not perform any repair

## fsck (filesystem check)

to run fsck on the filesystem

#fsck <options> <filesystem>
#fsck <options> <Mountpoint dir>

the options can be used with the fsck command::

-p automatic repair (no questions)
-y assume yes to all questions
-c check for bad blocks and add them to the badblock list
-f force checking even if filesystem is marked clean
-v be verbose 
-b superblock use alternate superblock

procedure to run fsck on the filesystem

1.the filesystem should be in inactive state
2.if the filesystem is in active state, unmount it 
3.now run fsck on the filesystem

## how to actually run it 

df -h 
umount /dev/sda2 
fsck /dev/sda2 

echo $? -> to check the previously executed program is success or failure
     $? = inbuilt special variable 
if it returns

0 No errors
1 - Filesystem errors corrected
2- System should be rebooted
4 - Filesystem errors left uncorrected
8 - Operational error
16- Usage or syntax error
32 - Fsck canceled by user request
128 - Shared-library error
